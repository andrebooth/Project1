# Project1
for the first project, I wanted to make a grid style website.

With the help of css, I was able to make the website colorful and vibrant.

Each of the different grid boxes has a different color to it.

For the javascript/Jquery, I added a background color changer, since the website is vibrant I wanted to have some fun with the background.

I spent a good amount of time in the css aspects because that was the area I needed to review the most.

I am glad of how it all turned out for my first website.
